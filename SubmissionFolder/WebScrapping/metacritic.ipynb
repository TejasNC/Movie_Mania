      "2 Oppenheimer None ['It’s powerful, a technically dazzling achievement; so audacious is Nolan’s filmmaking that if it didn’t serve the story you’d think at times he was just showing off. He’s not.', 'The cumulative effect is so stunning and antithetical to anything Hollywood is doing at the moment – the equally audacious Barbie aside – that it feels like a completely different art form. And, frankly, hallelujah for that.', 'Oppenheimer is one of those shoot-for-the-moon projects that feels thrilling and wonky, brilliant and overstuffed, too much and yet not enough. It’s also a movie that brings to mind the difficult era-spanning epics of yesteryear, from Reds to The Right Stuff, and is a movie made by adults for adults yet done with the sweep and majesty we now associate with movies made for kids and teens.', 'Taut and sprawling, riveting and haunting: firing on all cylinders, Nolan tackles world-changing history with fearsome force and focus.', 'Oppenheimer is a towering achievement not just for Nolan, but for everyone involved. It is the kind of film that makes you appreciative of every aspect of filmmaking, blowing you away with how it all comes together in such a fitting fashion.', 'A masterfully constructed character study from a great director operating on a whole new level. A film that you don’t merely watch, but must reckon with.'] ['Arizona Republic', 'Time Out', 'Rolling Stone', 'Total Film', 'Collider', 'Empire']\n",
      "3 Joker None ['Featuring a riveting, fully realized, and Oscar-worthy performance by Joaquin Phoenix, Joker would work just as well as an engrossing character study without any of its DC Comics trappings; that it just so happens to be a brilliant Batman-universe movie is icing on the Batfan cake. You will likely leave Joker feeling like I did: unsettled and ready to debate the film for years to come.', 'More character study than comic book movie, and anchored by an Oscar-worthy Joaquin Phoenix, Joker is a bravura blockbuster that proves you don’t need superpowered scraps to dazzle.', 'Joaquin Phoenix is devastating as the villain-in-the-making in this incendiary tale of psychological escape and psychopathy.', 'Bold, devastating and utterly beautiful, Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have not just reimagined one of the most iconic villains in cinema history, but reimagined the comic book movie itself.', 'Phoenix has created a masterful performance for a film which itself feels like a masterpiece: a cracked masterpiece.', 'What a gloriously daring and explosive film Joker is. It’s a tale that’s almost as twisted as the man at its centre, bulging with ideas and pitching towards anarchy.'] ['IGN', 'Total Film', 'Time Out', 'Empire', 'CineVue', 'The Guardian']\n",

As for the storytellng, The Godfather is an intricately constructed gem that simultaneously kicks ass.\", 'The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion... It was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual.', \"The wedding sequence... is a virtuoso stretch of filmmaking: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather's world.\", \"In scene after scene -- the long wedding sequence, John Marley's bloody discovery in his bed, Pacino nervously smoothing down his hair before a restaurant massacre, the godfather's collapse in a garden -- Coppola crafted an enduring, undisputed masterpiece.

As his hardened but resilient friend, Freeman is simply miraculous, giving the role so much depth, dignity, and good humor that you feel that you've known this man forever.

      "7 Godzilla Minus One None ['Godzilla Minus One is a monster movie of singular power, using horror-infused kaiju spectacle to deliver an emotionally compelling story of grief, wartime trauma, and hope. Most importantly, its genre-leading visual effects scenes are complemented by richly soulful performances and humane themes of reconciliation and redemption.', 'Godzilla Minus One is the throwback movie that longtime Godzilla fans have been waiting for.', 'Despite a few lapses into lumpy melodrama, Yamazki’s thoughtful script holds firm and is dotted with delightful humor at just the right moments.', 'If you’re a fan of Godzilla, prepare to have your mind blown with Godzilla Minus One. Set your expectations high, and enjoy the ride.', 'The enduring quality of the 1953 original is rooted in its engagement with the twin atomic disasters of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. This prequel, similarly, yokes American imperialism, postwar malaise, survivor guilt and weaponised atomic power to produce the best action film of the year.', 'Come for the skyline-destroying radioactive dino, stay for the delicately etched portrait of recovery and self-forgiveness. Or vice versa. Just don’t miss the chance to remind yourself why the world fell for Godzilla in the first place.'] ['CineVue', 'Polygon', 'Variety', 'Film Threat', 'The Irish Times', 'Slate']\n",
      "8 Top Gun: Maverick None [\"Thrilling, moving and gloriously Cruisey, Joseph Kosinski's sequel to the 1986 hit is unquestionably the best studio action film in years.\", 'As much as “Top Gun: Maverick” whips from a technical, visceral, thrill-making, supersonic-level, the entire endeavor and every little moment of introspection, suffering and determination is all the more accentuated, strengthened and fist-pumpingly good because you care so damn much about the story, the people and their very human concerns.', 'When talking about Top Gun: Maverick, it’s hard not to sound hyperbolic, but this is the rare case where it absolutely deserves all the massive praise. Top Gun: Maverick improves upon the original in every conceivable way (well, the soundtrack doesn’t have Berlin, so that’s one strike against it), and does so in a way that might make this one of the greatest sequels ever made. It’s also hard not to say this might have some of the most exciting action scenes to ever hit the skies, and gives Cruise one of his best performances by returning to the role that made him a star. Top Gun: Maverick is a marvel of a film, one that will truly take your breath away.', 'No cynicism, just on-point sentiment and scintillating set-pieces. Top Gun: Maverick scores a direct hit on its twin targets of nostalgia and adrenaline.', 'The new film improves on the old one in every respect. The story is cleverer and more gripping, the dialogue is sharper and funnier, the relationships are richer, the aerial stunts are more likely to make you queasy.', 'As the jets cut through the atmosphere and brush their target soils in close-shave movements—all coherently edited by Eddie Hamilton—the sensation they generate feels miraculous and worthy of the biggest screen one can possibly find. Equally worthy of that big screen is the emotional strokes of “Maverick” that pack an unexpected punch. Sure, you might be prepared for a second sky-dance with “Maverick,” but perhaps not one that might require a tissue or two in its final stretch.'] ['The Telegraph', 'The Playlist', 'Collider', 'Total Film', 'BBC', 'RogerEbert.com']\n",
      "9 The Dark Knight None ['Beyond dark. It\\'s as black -- and teeming and toxic -- as the mind of the Joker. \"Batman Begins,\" the 2005 film that launched Nolan\\'s series, was a mere five-finger exercise. This is the full symphony.', 'Enthralling...An ambitious, full-bodied crime epic of gratifying scope and moral complexity, this is seriously brainy pop entertainment that satisfies every expectation raised by its hit predecessor and then some.', \"Bale again brilliantly personifies all the deep traumas and misgivings of Batman's alter ego, Bruce Wayne. A bit of Hamlet is in this Batman.\", 'Christopher Nolan has provided movie-goers with the best superhero movie to-date, outclassing previous titles both mediocre and excellent, and giving this franchise its \"The Empire Strikes Back.\"', 'Twisted, tortured, terrifying - and terrific.', 'The Dark Knight will give your adrenal glands their desired workout, but it will occupy your mind, too, and even lead it down some dim alleyways where most Hollywood movies fear to tread.'] ['Time', 'Variety', 'The Hollywood Reporter', 'ReelViews', 'New York Daily News', 'Village Voice']\n",
      "10 The Matrix None ['The Matrix slams you back in your chair, pops open your eyes and leaves your jaw hanging slack in amazement.', \"The Wachowskis do it so playfully well, keeping The Matrix's potentially confusing plot intelligible, intelligent, and suspenseful, that it doesn't matter.\", 'Bill Pope\\'s swooping, noir-inflected cinematography is wonderfully complemented by Owen Paterson\\'s inventive production design, a great soundtrack and the best fight choreography this side of Hong Kong. And even if this isn\\'t \"Blade Runner,\" it is very cool shit.', 'The Wachowski Brothers have created some of the most unrivaled and imaginative sci-fi in years.', 'A wildly cinematic futuristic thriller that is determined to overpower the imagination, The Matrix combines traditional science-fiction premises with spanking new visual technology in a way that almost defies description.', \"I'll just say to anyone lamenting the state of American cinema since the 1970s, if you're curious where the next generation of auteurs is coming from, look in the art houses and look in The Matrix.\"] ['Portland Oregonian', 'The A.V. Club', 'L.A. Weekly', 'TNT RoughCut', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Film Threat']\n",
      "11 Schindler's List None [\"The other key part is Schindler's Jewish accountant, played with self-effacing brilliance by Ben Kingsley, who gives the movie just the touch of warmth and sanity it needs.\", 'What is surprising is how well Spielberg captures the horror, moving his camera with the fury of a combat photographer on the run. [17 Dec 1993]', 'Director Steven Spielberg has achieved something close to the impossible--a morally serious, aesthetically stunning historical epic that is nonetheless readily accessible to a mass audience.', \"Spielberg restages the Holocaust with an existential vividness unprecedented in any nondocumentary film: He makes us feel as if we're living right inside the 20th century's darkest-and most defining-episode.\", 'What is most amazing about this film is how completely Spielberg serves his story. The movie is brilliantly acted, written, directed and seen. Individual scenes are masterpieces of art direction, cinematography, special effects, crowd control.', \"Evinces an artistic rigor and unsentimental intelligence unlike anything the world's most successful filmmaker has demonstrated before.\"] ['Film.com', 'Chicago Tribune', 'TV Guide Magazine', 'Entertainment Weekly', 'Chicago Sun-Times', 'Variety']\n",
      "12 Amadeus None ['Remains the most popularly successful film ever to render the inner life of an artist.', 'It still soars, but now it seems richer, more expansive. Amadeus reminds us that movies can be lyrical as well as vulgar, ambitious as well as playful, brilliant as well as down and dirty -- just like Amadeus himself.', \"This expands an already long movie to more than three hours, but this time there's no getting enough of a good thing. [2002 Director's Cut]\", 'One of the finest qualities of Amadeus is that it reminds us of those rare occasions when an Oscar sweep is actually merited.', \"Amadeus is about as close to perfection as movies get. [2002 Director's Cut]\", \"In what was indisputably his finest moment as a filmmaker, Forman summoned the absolute best work of his craftsmen -- costumes, makeup, camerawork, production design -- and merged them with his own storytelling sense and his special way with actors to create what has to stand as cinema's most successful musical epic.\"] ['L.A. Weekly', 'Chicago Tribune', 'San Francisco Chronicle', 'New Times (L.A.)', 'New York Daily News', 'Seattle Post-Intelligencer']\n",
      "13 Pulp Fiction None ['For a brutal black comedy about L.A. hitmen, Pulp Fiction bursts out of its binding with loopy delights. [14 Oct 1994]', \"Pulp Fiction isn't just funny. It's outrageously funny. [14 Oct 1994]\", 'The new King Kong of crime movies...Ferocious fun without a trace of caution, complacency or political correctness to inhibit its 154 deliciously lurid minutes.', 'Like \"Citizen Kane,\" Pulp Fiction is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next.', \"It is an exhilaration from beginning to end. It's the movie equivalent of that rare sort of novel where you find yourself checking to see how many pages are left and hoping there are more, not fewer.\", 'With this film, every layer that you peel away leads to something deeper and richer. Tarantino makes pictures for movie-lovers, and Pulp Fiction is a near-masterpiece.'] ['USA Today', 'Chicago Tribune', 'Rolling Stone', 'Chicago Sun-Times', 'San Francisco Chronicle', 'ReelViews']\n",
      "14 Mad Max: Fury Road None ['There is nothing easy or predictable about what George Miller delivers with Mad Max: Fury Road, a stone-cold action master class, beautiful and brainy and startling in the ways it throws off the current definition of the blockbuster.', 'Marrying the biting frenzy of Terry Gilliam’s film universe with the explosive grandeur of James Cameron, Miller cooks up some exhilaratingly sustained action.

The highest praise one can give the Sistrom production is to say that it is like a masterpiece of mystery fiction coming vividly to life on the screen.

He's through risking his neck to make us happy. With this film, Newman completes a cycle of five films over six years, and together they have something to say about the current status of heroism.

Its potency stems only partly from the boxoffice draw of William Holden and, to a lesser degree, Alec Guinness.

All of which makes Wilder’s masterpiece tough to take if you’re looking for a laugh riot.', 'Lemmon and MacLaine are magical together, and MacMurray more than holds his own as the third part of the triangle.

The major weakness, perhaps, of the whole thing is that it is inevitably compressive and sometimes glib. The strength and wonder of it is that it manages to say so much that still needs to be said.', 'Though unrelentingly bleak, Judgment at Nuremberg is absorbing from beginning to end.', \"There are no surprises in the direction, and Abby Mann's screenplay plays the expected tunes, but there's enough conviction on display to reward a patient spectator.\", \"Judgment at Nuremberg is twice the size of the concise, stirring and rewarding production on television's Playhouse 90 early in 1959.

After all, it’s much easier to not give up on a character when we see she hasn’t given up on herself. The movie further benefits from the absence of 1940s-style censorship, which suppressed a key plot detail that’s restored here.', 'A dreamy homage to old-school Hollywood as well as a haunting, female-driven psychological thriller with deep mystery and satisfying twists', 'It’s what James and Thomas bring to the table that makes this new adaptation of Rebecca worth watching.', \"With or without that hallowed history, it's hard not to feel the lack of something in director Ben Wheatley's lush, ponderous update — the most obvious thing, perhaps, being Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.\", 'Wheatley’s Rebecca is still a strong film when judged on its own.

Stylish, compelling, and involving, it became as much a blueprint for future productions as it is an homage to past ones.\", \"[Kurosawa] was deliberately combining the samurai story with the Western, so that the wind-swept main street could be in any frontier town, the samurai (Toshiro Mifune) could be a gunslinger, and the local characters could have been lifted from John Ford's gallery of supporting actors.\", \"One of the great samurai pictures, its darkly brilliant premise--the cynical mercenary/master swordsman or yojimbo (bodyguard) who walks into a town feud and plays both evil sides against each other--has been copied frequently, most notably in the Sergio Leone-Clint Eastwood A Fistful of Dollars. But Kurosawa's treatment remains the most savage, thrilling, smart and hideously funny. [26 Jan 2007, p.C2]\", 'The filmmaking is marvelously austere, yet in its sudden bursts of action electrifying, in its stern morality sobering, in the blackness of its comedy often quite delicious.'] ['Empire', 'Slant Magazine', 'ReelViews', 'Chicago Sun-Times', 'Chicago Tribune', 'Time']\n",

      "237 City Lights None ['There’s dignity and folly to The Tramp in City Lights, and everything in between.', \"If only one of Charles Chaplin's films could be preserved, “City Lights” (1931) would come the closest to representing all the different notes of his genius. It contains the slapstick, the pathos, the pantomime, the effortless physical coordination, the melodrama, the bawdiness, the grace, and, of course, the Little Tramp--the character said, at one time, to be the most famous image on earth.\", 'Both funny and touching, this showcases Chaplin at his best.', \"Of all Chaplin's films (with the possible exception of Modern Times), City Lights offers the fullest characterization of the Tramp. He's a loner who comes and goes almost like a dream figure or a drunken angel. Without family, friends, or a place to live, he stands outside of our reality, sometimes trying to fit in and sometimes not caring whether or not he does. Yet, like a child, he is a complete innocent with a pure heart and the best motives.\", \"A beautiful example of Chaplin's ability to turn narrative fragments into emotional wholes. The two halves of the film are sentiment and slapstick. They are not blended but woven into a pattern as eccentric as it is sublime.\", \"It was a joyous evening. Mr. Chaplin's shadow has grown no less.\"] ['The Dissolve', 'Chicago Sun-Times', 'Empire', 'ReelViews', 'Chicago Reader', 'The New York Times']\n",

Its effect is cumulative, however; the pace comes to seem perfectly suited to the material.', \"Yasujiro Ozu's portrait of familial relations, first seen in 1953, is marked by an indefinable melancholy that settles on the frame as softly as snow.\", 'Even on the basis of a limited exposure to his work, the story seems archetypal Ozu.', 'In this exquisite merging of specific and universal, infinite and infinitesimal, Tokyo Story perhaps most clearly illuminates that Ozu is not the most Japanese of filmmakers, but the most human.'] ['BBC', 'The Guardian', 'Chicago Sun-Times', 'The Independent', 'The New York Times', 'Slant Magazine']\n",
      "240 Wild Strawberries None [\"Possibly Ingmar Bergman's finest film and a landmark in film history.\", 'A wonderfully composed movie in which Ingmar Bergman is able to vary the tone from melancholy to gaiety in the most deeply satisfying way', 'This is one of the truly outstanding works of post-war European cinema.', 'The bitter has not yet overpowered the sweet in this early film from writer-director Ingmar Bergman.', 'Initially, Wild Strawberries appears to be an almost pointedly unsubtle coming-of-age story that’s been goosed with dime-store surrealism and male handwringing masked as intellectual engagement with humankind. But the bluntness is a misdirection that underlines the depth of Bergman’s empathy with his hero as well as his dedication to his real subject, which is the process of mentally freeing oneself from an insidiously limiting self-mythology.', 'The story now sounds like fodder for a rote “old codger learns to like people” narrative, but Wild Strawberries is more about a man’s gradual coming to terms with who he was, who he is, and what he’s leaving behind.'] ['TV Guide Magazine', 'The Guardian', 'BBC', 'LarsenOnFilm', 'Slant Magazine', 'IndieWire']\n",

Club', 'LarsenOnFilm']\n",
      "243 Mr. Smith Goes to Washington None ['There’s tremendous dramatic impact threaded throughout the picture, interwoven with those deft human episodes which have become familiar with Capra’s direction in previous pictures. He keys the motivation of his basic premise without wasting time, and then carries it through vigorously.', 'Demonstrating that the greatest political evil is indifference, this appeal to a world on the verge of war has lost none of its relevance.', '[Capra] has paced it beautifully and held it in perfect balance, weaving his romance lightly through the political phases of his comedy, flicking a sardonic eye over the Washington scene, racing out to the hinterland to watch public opinion being made and returning miraculously in time to tie all the story threads together into a serious and meaningful dramatic pattern.', 'While MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON is the most moral of films, it is so artfully filled with real emotion that it never becomes heavy-handed.', \"The acting of the brilliant cast is sometimes superb. But Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is bigger than any of these things. Its real hero is not calfy Jeff Smith, but the things he believes, as embodied in the hero of U. S. democracy's first crisis, Abraham Lincoln.\", 'This is classic Capracorn, with the greatest girl cynic of the 30s, Jean Arthur.'] ['Variety', 'Empire', 'The New York Times', 'TV Guide Magazine', 'Time', 'Chicago Reader']\n",
      "244 The Battle of Algiers None ['A prototype of news-footage realism, the film makes shrewd use of handheld sloppiness, misjudged focus, overexposure, and you-are-there camera upset; the payoff is the scent of authentic panic.', 'Like all masterpieces, it speaks to later ages as powerfully and intelligently as to its own.', 'Achieves its success through a combination of attitude and technique, uniting, to exceptional effect, a way of viewing the world morally while looking at it physically.', \"It's one of the best movies about revolutionary and anticolonial activism ever made, convincing, balanced, passionate, and compulsively watchable as storytelling.\", \"The Battle of Algiers is a thinking person's action film in which there are winners -- but no heroes.\", \"It's a masterpiece.\"] ['Village Voice', 'Christian Science Monitor', 'Los Angeles Times', 'Chicago Reader', 'Boston Globe', 'Philadelphia Inquirer']\n",
      "245 The Kid None ['The result is fine fantasy fun.', \"It's Willis who delivers the goods in scene after scene, triumphing over a thin script, often bland direction.\", 'Warm-hearted and effective.', 'A parable for adults -- particularly men.', \"It's a modest little fantasy. But it's also well made, unpretentious and refreshing.\", 'Too bad The Kid gets bogged down in its sentimental manipulations.

      "246 The Passion of Joan of Arc None ['To modern audiences, raised on films where emotion is conveyed by dialogue and action more than by faces, a film like The Passion of Joan of Arc is an unsettling experience--so intimate we fear we will discover more secrets than we desire.', 'The last silent film by Danish master Carl Theodor Dreyer, it largely eschewed traditional master shots for a dazzling range of expressive, character-probing close-ups: no historical biopic has ever felt quite so unnervingly intimate.', \"A stark and intense film, Jeanne d'Arc is renowned for its sparse shooting style - which focuses in on Falconetti's face with such relentless fascination that everything else (sets, props, secondary characters) disappear from view.\", \"Danish director Carl Dreyer's 1928 film The Passion Of Joan Of Arc is one of the indisputable masterpieces of the silent era.\", \"The chief reason for its legendary reputation is the brilliant match between its timeless historical subject - the trial that required Joan to defend her faith before skeptical representatives of church and state - and Dreyer's decision to film it primarily in relentless close-ups, using the sharply etched faces of his performers to suggest the invisible spiritual struggles going on beneath the drama's human dimensions.\", \"The entire film is less moulded in light than carved in stone: it's magisterial cinema, and almost unbearably moving.\"] ['Chicago Sun-Times', 'The Guardian', 'BBC', 'The A.V.
